Whiteboard for WordPress
===

This is an [underscore](http://underscores.me/) theme fork used by [adWhite](http://adWhite.com) to build themes and web projects using WordPress.

The only modifications are on the Sass files, the HTML structure, and the addition of a Gruntfile to help the development.

Forked and mantained by [adWhite](http://adWhite.com).
